# Crucial's Marketing

The main difference between Crucial and other ISPs is how Crucial markets its bandwidth to consumers. Traditionally, ISPs market speeds as a consistent BPS (eg. 100MBPS).

Although this is simple to understand for a consumer, it is not at all accurate. In reality, speeds are managed by either the ISP or whoever the ISP purchases bandwidth from dynamically. There are also network overheads to consider.

For example, if 10 businesses purchase a 100MBPS connection and 10 consumers purchase a 100MBPS connection, the ISP can monitor traffic from the 2 different connection types. Although the bandwidth totals 2GBPS, the 20 users are never all going to be using their connection at 100% capacity all the time. By cleverly managing the different connections through multiplexing, a 1GBPS pipe can handle all the connections and the users will (hopefully) not notice the speed difference.

The service provider can use any number of tactics to manage traffic. For example, the ISP notices that businesses use more bandwidth during the day, and consumers use more during the evening. The pipe prioritises business traffic during the day, and consumer traffic at night.

Crucial's point of difference is that it does not market internet speed as a consistent BPS. Instead, it aims to analyse the data obtained from inspecting the traffic, and give an expected speed based on network usage, as well as additional information on the network.

This means more transparency in the underlying infrastructure of the network. In the case of the 1GBPS pipe with 20 users, a data visualisation would be provided as a free service to users of the pipe (and potentially, anyone with internet access).

The presentation of the data is, of course, no trivial task. The traffic visualisation must be presented in a way that is appealing and easy to understand for consumers.

Also, underlying algorithms that split traffic are available to the consumer in clear visualisations (potentially as open source code depending on software mechanisms). This could be a contentious point for some ISPs, for whom [traffic shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping) is a "secret recipe" within their business.

The benefit is that by increasing transparency on network traffic, Crucial gains consumer trust. Again, the visualisation of this traffic is key, and no trivial task, as it is important that consumers' eyes don't glaze over as they are bored to death by networking nuances.

The other 2 points of difference - contracts and cost. Contracts are annoying to deal with for a consumer and reduce flexibility. There is opportunity here to automate the service - eg. a user can just sign up online and cancel online. Some ISPs may already do this, I haven't fully researched them all, but I know that big ones such as Spark and Orcon need 30 days notice. Also, many ISPs offer deals with 12 month contracts. Crucial will have none of this nonsense. Just a monthly service, that can be cancelled at any time. If a fibre connection and router are already in place, pretty much everything should be doable online within the need for a phone call or any technician visit.

Cost is important. A priority for Crucial is lowering costs as much as possible. Some advantage is gained from only offering one service (as we don't need support for ADSL, VDSL etc.) and ironically, by spending less on marketing costs can be lowered, which is marketing in and of itself. Subsidies (eg. from the government or a private fund) could end up being vital to keeping Crucial's cost at a minimum. Becoming a not-for-profit is an option, that is perhaps not as crazy as it sounds because with the principle of radical transparency comes some built-in protection from scrutiny (and I assume, legislation) that a not-for-profit will have to overcome.
