# Costs

Below are estimated costs for the project.

## Public Liability Insurance
For $1M - ~$1,000

## Chorus Payment guarantee
"Under the agreement we require payment guarantee that is equal to the average of 2 monthsâ€™ billing with Chorus (with a minimum of $10,000). This needs to be in place prior to services being provided. This can be provided either via a cash prepayment, a bank guarantee, letter of credit or performance bond. The amount is determined by the estimated spend for months 5 & 6 combined. Could you please fill in the table below with your best estimates on how many connections you expect to have at the 6 month mark for each product. I will then fill out the spend per month and workout the security requirement."

The only product being purchased is UFB (1 GBPS) at an estimated cost of $60 per customer.

## Design and development of website and branding
2 months development time @ $5000 total

## Research and Development costs
A part time developer and/or designer needed to help with the research and development workload of open source resource. Releasing documentation, diagrams and code which illustrate how the internet works from a networking layer perspective. 

1) Code base need for integration with Chorus' API (Application Programming Interface)
- Open source and will be publicly available.
- Developer (90 hours)

2) Diagram around the networking layer including fundamental of ISP operation.
- Router, ONT, Stations, Southern Cross line, Servers
- Designer (80 hours)

3) Research topic: Multi-plexing
Show real time data visualisation of bandwidth usage across the network as a public resource. Could be a first for an ISP.
- Show capacity across example connection, bandwidth topography
- Developer (110 hours) needed to develop browser web application to show network topography.

~$30 per hour x 280 hours = $8,400

## Running costs

Server uptake

## Marketing

Budget of $1,000. I'm not a marketing expert but this should be spent on promoting Crucial's spin, which is "low cost, 1 simple to understand product, radical transparency and a massive improvement over existing ISPs' bullshit (contracts, misleading speeds and inflated costs)." Something like FB ads would be a place to start. PR from news articles or other online sources would be a bonus.

| Object        | Cost           |

## Goals

Crucial has simple goals, to be achieved within a year of its inception.

1. A web portal that allows users to see their connection status and billing. Users should be able to cancel online, and _potentially_ sign up online if the fibre infrastructure is already in place. This will probably require orchestration with Chorus.

2. If fibre infrastructure is not in place, _strive_ to get an exact date on when the fibre will be installed for the customer. This will be a complex orchestration of all the puzzle pieces that go into installing fibre for a consumer. I do not expect this to be easy.

3. 5,000 customers on a non-throttled fibre connection, targeting Auckland and Wellington to begin with, and expanding if appropriate and feasible. Limiting to 2 regions allows for easier analysis of infrastructure such as network pipe capacity from each household.

4. Routers/modems will not be sold initially, but information will be available to customers about what routers work/how to set them up. This is another weak point alongside fibre installation. Wholesale purchase of routers and onselling to customers is a longer term goal. Ultimately, the goal is to make router setup as simple as possible (in line with Crucial's philosophy).
