# Costs

Below are estimated costs for the project.

## Public Liability Insurance
For $1M - ~$1000

## Chorus Payment guarantee
"Under the agreement we require payment guarantee that is equal to the average of 2 monthsâ€™ billing with Chorus (with a minimum of $10,000). This needs to be in place prior to services being provided. This can be provided either via a cash prepayment, a bank guarantee, letter of credit or performance bond. The amount is determined by the estimated spend for months 5 & 6 combined. Could you please fill in the table below with your best estimates on how many connections you expect to have at the 6 month mark for each product. I will then fill out the spend per month and workout the security requirement."

The only product being purchased is UFB (1 GBPS) at an estimated cost of $60 per customer.

1000 customers at 6 month mark, with 2 months billing for Chorus payment guaranteed - $60 * 1000 = $60,000 * 2 = $120,000

## Design and development of website and branding
2 months development time @ $5000 total

## Customer Support Team
Note that long term, it would be better to have an AI assisted support team (such as a chatbot) that can handle technical issues. It is possible to automate the support team before use of AI though, by only offering an email contact for support on the website (Bigpipe apparently does this). Although support team salary can be paid out of revenue, a buffer is a good idea to ensure that capacity for support is comfortable. Estimated buffer of $5000.

## Marketing

Budget of $10,000. I'm not a marketing expert but this should be spent on promoting Crucial's spin, which is "low cost, 1 simple to understand product, radical transparency and a massive improvement over existing ISPs' bullshit (contracts, misleading speeds and inflated costs)." Something like FB ads would be a place to start. PR from news articles or other online sources would be a bonus.
