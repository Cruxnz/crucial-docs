# Costs

Below are estimated costs for the project.

## Public Liability Insurance
For $1M - ~$1,000

## Chorus Payment guarantee
"Under the agreement we require payment guarantee that is equal to the average of 2 monthsâ€™ billing with Chorus (with a minimum of $10,000). This needs to be in place prior to services being provided. This can be provided either via a cash prepayment, a bank guarantee, letter of credit or performance bond. The amount is determined by the estimated spend for months 5 & 6 combined. Could you please fill in the table below with your best estimates on how many connections you expect to have at the 6 month mark for each product. I will then fill out the spend per month and workout the security requirement."

The only product being purchased is UFB (1 GBPS) at an estimated cost of $60 per customer.

## Design and development of website and branding
2 months development time @ $5000 total

## Customer Support Team
Note that long term, it would be better to have an AI assisted support team (such as a chatbot) that can handle technical issues. It is possible to automate the support team before use of AI though, by only offering an email contact for support on the website (Bigpipe apparently does this). Although support team salary can be paid out of revenue, a buffer is a good idea to ensure that capacity for support is comfortable. Estimated buffer of $5000.

## Marketing

Budget of $1,000. I'm not a marketing expert but this should be spent on promoting Crucial's spin, which is "low cost, 1 simple to understand product, radical transparency and a massive improvement over existing ISPs' bullshit (contracts, misleading speeds and inflated costs)." Something like FB ads would be a place to start. PR from news articles or other online sources would be a bonus.

## Goals

Crucial has simple goals, to be achieved within a year of its inception.

1. A web portal that allows users to see their connection status and billing. Users should be able to cancel online, and _potentially_ sign up online if the fibre infrastructure is already in place. This will probably require orchestration with Chorus.

2. If fibre infrastructure is not in place, _strive_ to get an exact date on when the fibre will be installed for the customer. This will be a complex orchestration of all the puzzle pieces that go into installing fibre for a consumer. I do not expect this to be easy.

3. 5,000 customers on a non-throttled fibre connection, targeting Auckland and Wellington to begin with, and expanding if appropriate and feasible. Limiting to 2 regions allows for easier analysis of infrastructure such as network pipe capacity from each household.

4. Routers/modems will not be sold initially, but information will be available to customers about what routers work/how to set them up. This is another weak point alongside fibre installation. Wholesale purchase of routers and onselling to customers is a longer term goal. Ultimately, the goal is to make router setup as simple as possible (in line with Crucial's philosophy).
